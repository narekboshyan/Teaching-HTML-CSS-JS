    <!-- The header tag defines the introductory content, and as a non-sectioning content tag, it does not show on the page outline. This means it can be used inside an article with the article title and posted date, inside the body with the side logo and navigation, inside an aside tag with a search form, inside a nav or section tag with the nav title, etc. -->
    <header>HEADER</header>

    <!-- The nav tag is a special sectioning tag. It should contain navigation details for the current or another page. It can be titled and used for the main page navigation, table of contents, indexes, breadcrumbs, etc. -->
    <nav>NAV</nav>

    <!-- A section should appear in the outline of the document and can be used for things like search results, page hero, group post categories, etc. If you use the section tag without a title, it won't appear in the outline. Besides, a titled section is good for SEO and accessibility. Untitled sections are common in web applications rather than websites, and in case you want the section to appear in the document outline and not be visible to the user, you can make the title hidden. -->
    <section>SECTION</section>

    <!-- The article tag follows all the rules of a section tag. It must have a title and the content should make sense together. What makes it different is that its content should be standalone content that is independent of the rest of the page. -->
    <article>ARTICLE</article>
    <!-- 
		The main tag is used to contain or expand on the main topic of the page. It must come once per page, and if more than one is included, all but one should have the hidden attribute.
	-->
    <main>MAIN</main>
    <!-- The aside tag should contain content that relates to the main tag’s content. Let's say the main tag’s content has an article about a travel destination. You can use the aside tag to show related facts about the destination or travel costs that the user can snack on quickly. 
	You can put the aside tag inside other tags like articles, sections, and even the main tag. The only exception is the address tag. This is because it is a complementary tag and can be used as a sidebar or call-out box.
	-->
    <aside>ASIDE</aside>

    <!-- The footer tag is often used as the page footer, but it can actually go inside any content flow tag except the header and address tags. It cannot be nested as well, and that means that you can use it for the main content, article, section, and more sectioning tags. -->
    <footer>FOOTER</footer>

    <!-- The figure and figcaption tags are used to contextualize content that can be images, illustrations, code snippets, diagrams, quotations, poems, etc. Because of its name, developers normally associate the figure tag with a way to add captions to some imagery, but it can be used for more than that. -->
    <figure>
      <figcaption>How to find average value</figcaption>
